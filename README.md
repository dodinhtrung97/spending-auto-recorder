### Atomic Design

* Atoms – The smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs or event color pallets, animations, and fonts.

* Molecules – They are the composition of one or more components of atoms.

* Organisms – The combination of molecules that work together or even with atoms that compose more elaborate interfaces.

Remembering the directories we use to organize your components:

```
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │  ├── atoms
│   │  ├── molecules
│   │  ├── organisms
``` 

In each component directory, we have an index.js file that exports the specified category.
